/* psx_fusion_manager.h — VIEW > FUSION MANAGER.
 *
 * A second OS window, like the Drop Table Manager and the Dialogue Manager,
 * over the game's own fusion tables (psx_fusion_db.h). Two views on the same
 * index:
 *
 *   BY CARD   every card, sortable and searchable, with two panels for the
 *             selected one: FUSES WITH (every partner and what the pair
 *             makes, equips included) and MADE FROM (every pair that makes
 *             it). Clicking a card name in either panel walks to that card,
 *             and Backspace walks back.
 *   RECIPES   every recipe in the game as one flat sortable list.
 *
 * And it EDITS them. The edit line under FUSES WITH takes a partner id and
 * what the pair should make (0 removes the fusion); double-clicking a row
 * fills it in. psx_fusion_table.c owns the data and the change: it reads the
 * stock table off the disc — so this window needs no duel and works from
 * boot — packs the edits back into the game's own format and installs them
 * as a disc-sector override, which is what makes the AI use them too.
 * MODS > FUSION EDITS turns that override on and off; Import…/Export… move
 * a recipe list in and out as text.
