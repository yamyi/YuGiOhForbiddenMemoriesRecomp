/* psx_cpu_data.h — what a CPU duelist is made of, and the player's edits to it.
 *
 * Three things belong to an opponent and are kept here; the CPU Manager
 * window (psx_cpu_manager.c) is the UI over them.
 *
 *   DECK    the weighted pool the game draws their 40 cards from, one array
 *           per duelist in their disc record. Edited through a sector
 *           override, so the game loads the edited pool itself.
 *   AI      the nine-byte profile at gDuel_aOpponentData, which is what the
 *           duel AI reads about the opponent it is playing as.
 *   RECORD  wins and losses, in the save.
 *
 * Deck and AI edits live in cpu_manager.ini beside the player's saves; the
 * record is the save's own and is written straight into it.
