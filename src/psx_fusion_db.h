/* The game's own fusion data — Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories.
 *
 * Answers "what do these two cards make?" by running the guest's own lookup
 * over the guest's own tables, read live out of guest RAM. No baked table, no
 * reimplemented rules: every address and every step below was read off the
 * recompiled routines the game calls when a fusion resolves, so this stays
 * correct for any build of the game whose data lives at those addresses, and
 * fails closed (`psx_fusion_db_ready` returns 0) when it does not.
 *
 * This file is data and queries only. Nothing here knows about a duel, a hand
 * or a screen — psx_fusion_assist.c owns that.
