/* psx_fusion_db.c — the game's fusion data, read live. See psx_fusion_db.h.
 *
 * ---- how a fusion is decided ----------------------------------------------
 *
 * Forbidden Memories resolves a two-card summon in func_8001A280, which makes
 * exactly three attempts and takes the first that answers (established by
 * tracing the calls during a real in-duel fusion, 2026-08-18):
 *
 *     v0 = func_80019A60(first, second)          the fusion table
 *     if (v0) -> that card is summoned
 *     v0 = func_80019A08(second, first)          equip table, one order
 *     if (v0) -> v0 (== first) survives
 *     v0 = func_80019A08(first, second)          equip table, other order
 *     if (v0) -> v0 (== second) survives
 *     otherwise no fusion: `second` is summoned as itself
 *
 * The two ids it passes come from the 28-byte card records the duel keeps at
 * 0x801A7AE4 (`lh a0, 14016(v0)` with v0 = slot*28 + 0x801A4424); the id is at
 * record+0. psx_fusion_assist.c owns that array.
 *
 * ---- func_80019A60: the fusion table --------------------------------------
 *
 * Base 0x8017C2D8. The routine sorts its arguments first, so a pair is stored
 * exactly once, under min(a,b), with max(a,b) as the partner:
 *
 *     off = u16 at base + min*2          0 -> this card fuses with nothing
 *     rec = base + off
 *     count = rec[0]                     body at rec+1
 *             ...unless rec[0] == 0, in which case
 *             count = 511 - rec[1]       body at rec+2   (counts 256..511)
 *
 * The body is groups of FIVE bytes, each carrying TWO (partner, result) pairs.
 * Card ids are 10 bits, and the four high halves are packed into the group's
 * first byte, two bits each:
 *
 *     partner1 = ((g[0] << 8) & 0x300) | g[1]
 *     result1  = ((g[0] << 6) & 0x300) | g[2]
 *     partner2 = ((g[0] << 4) & 0x300) | g[3]
 *     result2  = ((g[0] << 2) & 0x300) | g[4]
 *
 * An ODD count writes only THREE bytes for the final group (g[0..2]) — the
 * one entry it holds — but the guest's loop consumes two entries per group and
 * stops on `count <= 0` AFTER the decrement, so it still tests a second half
 * that is not there: g[3] and g[4] are the FIRST TWO BYTES OF THE NEXT RECORD.
 *
 * That is not padding and it does not read as zero. Of the 293 odd records in
 * the shipping table, 263 decode to a nonzero result; 245 name a partner below
 * the record's own card id (the lookup sorts its arguments, so that record is
 * never the one consulted for the pair), 1 is out of range, and 2 name a
 * partner an earlier entry in the same record already answered. The remaining
 * FIFTEEN are pairs the game really does fuse and the table never meant to
 * hold — the "glitch fusions":
 *
 *     22+31=72   23+147=4   26+138=4    31+34=84    40+126=4
 *     45+170=136 61+144=136 64+168=72   66+98=132   74+150=72
 *     90+130=136 96+231=136 120+166=132 127+128=72  167+225=64
 *
 * Copying the guest's loop, as pair_lookup does below, reproduces all fifteen
 * for free. An ENUMERATION has to be more careful — see the walk near the end
 * of this file. (Established against the disc bytes and a transcription of the
 * lookup over all 261003 unordered pairs, 2026-09-05.)
 *
 * ---- func_80019A08: the equip table ---------------------------------------
 *
 * Base 0x8017A1D8. A flat list of groups, terminated by a zero key:
 *
 *     u16 key            an equip card
 *     u16 count
 *     u16 member[count]  the monsters it may attach to
 *
 * The routine returns its SECOND argument when that argument is in the first
 * argument's member list. That is the equip mechanic: the monster stays on the
 * field and the equip powers it up, so the monster is the "result". 34 groups
 * covering 4041 memberships in the shipping data — this is the whole of the
 * "magic cards that fuse" behaviour.
 *
 * ---- why read the tables instead of calling the guest ---------------------
 *
 * psx_card_drops.c re-runs the game's own drop roll through psx_dispatch_call
 * because that roll is stateful: it draws from a per-opponent pool and burns
 * RNG, and reimplementing it would silently drift. Nothing here is stateful.
 * These are two static tables in the game's data segment, and the lookups are
 * the pure functions transcribed above, so reading the tables IS the game's
 * answer — with none of the cost or risk of re-entering guest code from a
 * frame tick, which is what an assistant that re-evaluates on every hand
 * change would be doing dozens of times a second.
 *
 * Both tables are DUEL data: the game streams them in from disc when a duel
 * starts and they read back as solid zeros everywhere else, the same way the
 * rank coefficients psx_rank_logic.c uses do. That is why readiness is probed
 * rather than assumed, and why this module answers only inside a duel -- which
 * is the only place the question is asked anyway. The probe leans on the EQUIP
 * table, not this one: psx_fusion_table.c can legitimately empty the fusion
 * table, and a probe that treats "empty" as "absent" would report the tables
 * missing when they are merely bare.
 *
 * Checked against the game itself rather than against a FAQ: five pairs were
 * injected into a live duel's hand records and summoned, and the game produced
 * exactly what these tables predict, including two cases where the widely
 * mirrored GameFAQs fusion list is wrong (Air Marmot of Nefariousness +
 * Greenkappa is Tiger Axe, not Flower Wolf; Dissolverock + Skull Servant is
 * Stone Ghost, not Flame Ghost) and one where it invents a fusion that does
 * not exist (Bone Mouse + Skull Servant).
