/* psx_wa_catalog.c -- tell the texture-pack framework what this title's art is
 * called, so a pack author edits cards/001/image.png and not a hash.
 *
 * This is the whole game-specific surface of texture packs. texture_pack.c
 * knows nothing about MRG files or card ids; it is handed
 *
 *     "an upload whose payload hashes to H is the art called N"
 *
 * and does the rest. Everything below is just working out H and N for the art
 * this disc holds.
 *
 * WHERE THE OFFSETS COME FROM
 * ----------------------------
 * WA_MRG.MRG starts at disc LBA 10102, and the per-card record layout is the
 * one tools/wa_assets.py documents and verifies by eye: records of 0x3800 from
 * 0x169000, each holding a 102x96 8bpp portrait at +0 and a 40x32 thumbnail at
 * +0x2AE0, pixel data first and CLUT after (TIM with the header stripped).
 *
 * The record stride is 0x3800 and NOT the 0x31E0 its contents occupy -- each
 * record is padded out to a sector boundary. Getting that wrong still decodes
 * card 1 correctly and turns every later card into noise, which is exactly how
 * it was caught.
 *
 * WHAT IS HASHED, AND THE RISK IN IT
 * -----------------------------------
 * The hash covers the PIXEL BYTES only -- 102*96 for a portrait -- because
 * that is what the game uploads to VRAM. The CLUT that follows on disc travels
 * separately and lands somewhere else in VRAM, so including it would
 * guarantee a mismatch.
 *
 * That leaves one assumption this cannot check without running: that the game
 * uploads a portrait as ONE transfer of exactly those bytes. If it stages them
 * through a larger buffer, or uploads a sub-rectangle at a time, the payload
 * hash will not match and the card simply never resolves. That is why
 * psx_wa_catalog_state_json() reports how many assets were registered
 * alongside texpack_state_json()'s live region count: registered-but-never-
 * matched is the signature of exactly this, and it is a fact about the game's
 * loader, not a bug in the hashing.
