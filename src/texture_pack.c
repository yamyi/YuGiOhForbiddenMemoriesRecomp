 *
 * THE THREE THINGS THIS KEEPS TRACK OF
 * -------------------------------------
 *   assets   what the title told us its art is called, keyed by content hash.
 *            Pure data, set up once, never invalidated.
 *   regions  where art currently LIVES in VRAM. Built from uploads, torn down
 *            whenever anything overwrites the rectangle. This is the part that
 *            has to be correct or replacements attach to the wrong pixels.
 *   entries  replacement images from the active pack, placed in the atlas.
 *            Loaded lazily, on the first draw that actually wants one, so a
 *            720-card pack does not cost 720 decodes at boot.
 *
 * WHY REGIONS EXPIRE
 * -------------------
 * VRAM is one megabyte that the game reuses constantly: the same address holds
 * a card portrait now and a menu panel a moment later. A region therefore
 * means "as of the last write, these words are that asset", and ANY later
 * write over them ends it. Uploads, fills and VRAM->VRAM copies all invalidate,
 * which is why the facade forwards all three rather than just transfers. Miss
 * one and a pack eventually paints the wrong art onto something -- the failure
 * is rare, timing-dependent and horrible to chase, so the invalidation is
 * deliberately blunt: any overlap at all kills the region.
 *
 * THE RESOLVE CACHE
 * ------------------
 * texpack_on_draw() runs per primitive, and a scene is thousands of them, so
 * the answer is cached against the primitive's texture state. A generation
 * counter bumps on every invalidation, which retires the whole cache at a
 * stroke -- correct by construction and cheaper than tracking which entries a
 * particular rectangle touched.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE PRINTS. psxrecomp/CLAUDE.md rule 3 forbids printf/fprintf in
 * runtime source outright: inspection goes through the TCP debug server, not
 * stdout. So the things worth knowing -- how many assets the title registered,
 * how many regions are live, and every reason a replacement was refused -- are
 * COUNTED here and served by texpack_state_json(), the same shape the rest of
 * this title uses (see psx_card_colors_state_json). A silently skipped
 * replacement is the most likely thing to go wrong with a pack, so the refusal
 * counters are the ones that matter: they turn "my art does not show up" into
 * a number that says which of the three reasons it was.
