/* psx_fusion_table.h — the game's fusion table as an editable thing.
 *
 * psx_fusion_db.c answers "what do these two cards make?" out of the RAM the
 * duel is using. This owns the other half: the table's bytes ON THE DISC, the
 * player's changes to them, and putting the two together.
 *
 * WHY THE DISC AND NOT RAM. The table is duel data — the loader streams it in
 * at the start of every duel and outside one the RAM copy reads as zeros — so
 * anything sourced from RAM can only work inside a duel, which is the one
 * place you are not building a deck. The same bytes sit in WA_MRG.MRG and
 * `psx_mod_cd_read_stock_sector` will hand them over at any moment, game
 * running or not. Everything here is therefore available from boot.
 *
 * HOW AN EDIT REACHES THE GAME. Not by patching code: the seven per-terrain
 * copies of the table are replaced as DISC SECTORS (`psx_mod_cd_override_*`),
 * exactly the way psx_card_effects.c already replaces the equip and ritual
 * tables in the same block, so the game's own loader brings the edited table
 * in and every reader — the summon resolver and all three AI planners — sees
 * it. A duel already in progress is additionally poked in RAM so a change
 * lands without leaving the duel.
 *
 * THE ONE HARD LIMIT is the format's, not this module's: the loader copies
 * exactly 0x10000 bytes and record offsets are 16-bit, so the whole table must
 * pack into 65535 bytes. Stock uses 65002 of them. An edit that would not fit
 * is refused with the numbers, and nothing changes.
