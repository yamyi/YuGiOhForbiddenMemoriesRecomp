/* texture_pack.h -- draw HD art in place of the game's own 2D textures.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY IT IS NOT A DISC PATCH
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * Patching art into the disc image cannot give you HD: the game decompresses
 * its art into RAM and hands it to the GPU at the original size, so a bigger
 * picture on the disc is just a bigger picture the game will not read. The
 * swap has to happen where the art reaches the renderer.
 *
 * Every piece of 2D art travels one road to the screen -- a CPU->VRAM transfer,
 * already decompressed, delivered to the renderer as one bulk rectangle by
 * gr_vram_transfer_in(). Watching that road catches all of it without knowing
 * anything about how the disc is laid out.
 *
 * NAMES, NOT HASHES
 * ------------------
 * An upload is identified by the content hash of its payload, but a hash is a
 * miserable thing to hand a pack author. So the TITLE registers what its art
 * is called -- "this hash is cards/042/image" -- and packs are then ordinary
 * directories of PNGs whose paths mirror those names:
 *
 *     <player data>/textures/cards/042/image.png
 *
 * That registration is the whole game-specific surface. This file knows
 * nothing about MRG files, card ids or where a disc keeps its artwork; it is
 * handed names and hashes and does the rest. A title that registers nothing
 * still gets a working framework, just one where nothing is ever replaced.
 *
 * INTEGER SCALES ONLY
 * --------------------
 * A replacement must be a whole multiple of the source's texel size: 102x96
 * art is replaced at 204x192, 408x384, and so on. Anything else is refused
 * rather than stretched -- counted in texpack_state_json()'s refusal tally,
 * since nothing here may print -- because the shader maps a primitive's
 * uv into the replacement as
 *
 *     atlas_texel = atlas_origin + (uv - region_origin) * scale
 *
 * and a fractional scale makes that inexact. The error shows up as seams along
 * sprite edges -- worst precisely where the art is cut into pieces, which on a
 * PS1 title is everywhere.
 *
 * WHAT A PALETTE SWAP DOES TO THIS
 * ---------------------------------
 * The console recolours art by swapping CLUTs rather than by storing several
 * copies, and a flat RGBA replacement cannot do that. So the lookup key is the
 * texture hash AND the CLUT hash, with a palette-agnostic fallback:
 *
 *     <name>.png              any palette -- one picture for every variant
 *     <name>@<cluthash>.png   this palette only
 *
 * The exact form wins when present. A pack that does not care about recolours
 * ships the plain file and never thinks about it; a pack that does ships one
 * per palette and keeps the variation.
 *
 * BACKENDS
 * ---------
 * Tracking and lookup here are backend-independent, but only the OpenGL
 * backend can currently DRAW a replacement -- it already samples VRAM as an
 * integer texture and decodes CLUTs in the fragment shader, which is the shape
 * a replacement path slots into. On Vulkan and software a pack is inert and
 * the stock art draws.
