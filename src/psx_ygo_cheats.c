/* --- Is a save actually resident? ----------------------------------------
 * `psx_mod_game_started()` is NOT this question, and three rows below were
 * asking it as if it were. From fntrace.c it is a one-shot that fires the
 * first time the game EXE's entry_pc is dispatched, so it is already true
 * during the Konami cards, throughout the intro movie, on the title screen,
 * and on the name-entry screen of a brand new game. Those rows write SAVE
 * data, and before a save exists their addresses belong to the boot sequence.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-21 on the debug build: toggling ALL CARDS during the intro
 * scrambles the movie into macroblock garbage and then the picture stops
 * advancing for good — the emulator keeps running at full speed and the CD
 * keeps streaming, but the game never reaches the title. Filling each of that
 * row's three destinations on its own attributes it exactly: the two save
 * struct copies change nothing, 0x80105D98 alone reproduces it every time.
 *
 * The save struct carries its own signature. Its first 0x50 bytes are the
 * 40-card deck, one u16 card id per slot, and ids run 1..722; the region is
 * all zeros on every screen that precedes a save. So "forty halfwords, every
 * one of them a real card id" separates the two cases outright — measured
 * false on the intro, the title and name entry, and true in all twelve
 * in-game states on hand. Same self-identifying trick psx_drop_missing.c uses
 * to name a duellist from its resident drop table instead of trusting an
 * index, and deliberately not a timer: "wait N seconds after boot" is a guess
 * that a slow load breaks, while this asks the actual question. */

 * "keep this hand face down" flag. Nothing here draws anything: the game
 * already knows how to draw their hand exactly like yours, and this only
 * clears the flag that tells it not to.
 *
 * Read three times, all in the card-display path, all testing the SIGN:
 *
 *   0x80017DF0 / 0x80017E20 (func_80017DB4)  hand card -> display byte +103
 *   0x80018058              (func_80018004)  same, single-card path
 *   0x800232C0              (func_80023144)  card tint byte at 0x8009B34E
 *
 * Zero skips the hide path outright; only a NEGATIVE value makes the first two
 * write 255 — the "card back" graphic index — instead of the real artwork
 * index, and makes the third leave the card on its dimmed tint. So clearing
 * the byte both turns the backs into real card sprites (art, name, ATK/DEF)
 * and un-greys them, through the game's own renderer.
 *
 * Duel init seeds both structs from one global (0x8001767C–0x80017690) and
 * then, for a CPU opponent, overwrites the opponent's copy with -1
 * (0x800176A8 `li $v0,-1`; 0x800176AC `sb $v0,-0x5FD1($v1)` => 0x800EA02F).
 * This is the flag the well-known `300EA02F 0000` GameShark code clears.
 *
 * Per frame, not once: a block copy at 0x8007431C rewrites +0x1A..+0x1F as a
 * unit — measured once per opponent turn across a full traced turn — so a
 * single write gets undone. Only a negative value is replaced, so a duel the
 * game itself chose to show face-up is never touched, and switching the row
 * off restores the -1 only if we were the ones who cleared it. */

 * The duel keeps one 28-byte record per card in play from 0x801A7AE4:
 * 0-4 player hand, 5-14 player field, 15-19 opponent hand, 20-29 opponent
 * field. Halfword +10 is that card's flags, and **bit 0x1000 is "face down"**.
 *
 * Unlike SHOW OPPONENT HAND, this bit is real game state, not just display.
 * It is read by the display builders (0x80017EA0, 0x800180C0, 0x8001EA20 —
 * each turns it into a sprite attribute byte) AND by the battle routine
 * `func_8001D670` at 0x8001E700, which is what flips a set monster face-up
 * when it is attacked. Clearing it does not merely draw the card face-up; the
 * card genuinely IS face-up, and will not flip when attacked.
 *
 * The placement routine `func_8001BD8C` ORs 0x1000 in as the AI puts a card
 * down (0x8001C3A8, 0x8001CCE4) and the field record inherits it from the hand
 * record. Measured on a specimen where the AI was forced to set a monster: the
 * card lands as 0x9800 (face-down + defense) stock, and as 0x8800 (defense,
 * face-up) with the hand record pre-cleared. Clearing an ALREADY-placed field
 * record works too, but only redraws when something rebuilds the view, so both
 * ranges are swept every frame.
 *
 * This is the well-known `5000051C 0000` + `301A7C93 0080` GameShark pair —
 * a repeat modifier writing 0x80 to +11 (the flags high byte) of records 15-19.
 * We clear the BIT rather than stomping the byte: GameShark had no choice, but
 * the byte also carries 0x0800 (defense position), and stomping it flips a
 * defending monster into attack. Measured — that is a real state change, not a
 * cosmetic one, so it is not something a "show me their cards" row should do.
 *
 * One-way on purpose: switching the row off stops clearing, it does not put
 * 0x1000 back. Re-hiding a card the game has already resolved as face-up would
 * desync the display from what the battle code just used. */
