/* psx_texture_export.c -- write this disc's stock art into a texture pack, so
 * there is something to paint over.
 *
 * This is the other half of psx_wa_catalog.c. That file hashes each asset and
 * registers it under a name; this one decodes the same asset and writes it to
 * a PNG under that same name, both driven by the one table in
 * psx_wa_catalog.h. Extractor and injector therefore cannot disagree about
 * what anything is called -- which they otherwise would, silently, and the
 * only symptom would be art that never appears.
 *
 * IT NEVER OVERWRITES THE PLAYER'S ART
 * -------------------------------------
 * The whole point of the folder is that the player replaces its contents with
 * HD art, so an exporter that clobbered what it found would destroy exactly
 * the work it exists to enable. An upscale is therefore never touched.
 *
 * Its OWN previous output is another matter. A file at exactly the stock size
 * is one of these exports, not a replacement -- painting over art at 1x would
 * be invisible, so nobody does it -- and refreshing those is what makes a fix
 * to the export actually reach the player. Otherwise every improvement to what
 * comes out of here is skipped in silence and the player upscales a stale
 * file. Re-running is safe, and is how you both top up new assets and pick up
 * corrections to old ones.
 *
 * ON DEMAND, NOT A FRAME HOOK
 * -----------------------------
 * psx_texture_export_one() decodes and writes exactly one asset, synchronously,
 * when its caller asks -- psx_asset_manager.c's Export/Export All buttons are
 * the only callers, and Export All spreads its own ~2700 calls one asset (or
 * a handful) per frame from ITS OWN tick(), the same "don't freeze the game"
 * reasoning this file used to apply itself via an automatic "Mods > Export
 * stock textures" background walker. That walker is gone: driving this from
 * the Asset Manager makes it explicit and on-demand instead of a standing
 * frame hook nothing outside the Asset Manager needs.
 *
 * PNG, WITHOUT A COMPRESSOR
 * --------------------------
 * The IDAT is a zlib stream of STORED (uncompressed) deflate blocks. That is a
 * real PNG every viewer and editor accepts, and it needs nothing linked in.
 * The files are bigger than a compressed PNG -- about 40 KB for a card
 * portrait -- which is irrelevant for something the player is about to replace
 * anyway, and cheaper than taking a dependency for it.

     * (write_elements), and no whole-sheet file at all. What lands on disk is
     * what was on screen; there is nothing left to infer.

     * whole-page export: their workflow is a single alpha mask painted over

     * construction, precisely because it carries no baked colour of its own.

     * palette recurs -- correct for art with one true colouring, but it
     * would let a single painted glyph freeze to one colour forever, which
     * is the opposite of what tinting the font buys: dialogue white, a card
     * name in whatever colour its type gives it, from the one file.

     * the boot logo's hieroglyph layer, ui/panels) -- art with exactly ONE
     * true palette, just not yet a known one. That is not the "pixels times
     * palette" ambiguity this branch exists for; it is the same shape as a
     * card or a background, and belongs on the plain path below with them.
     * The condition used to be `tint != 1`, which caught tint == -1 too and
     * multi-region-dumped these into scattered per-rectangle files with no
     * single picture to look at or paint -- correct only for genuinely
     * multi-palette UI (duel_labels, the menu labels, guardian-star-turned-
