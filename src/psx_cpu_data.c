 * WHERE A DUELIST LIVES
 * ---------------------
 * DECK. Every opponent has a 6144-byte record on the disc, three sectors at
 * WA_MRG's sector 0x1D33 + 3*id, read into 0x801781D8 before a duel
 * [func_800179F4]. The
 * record is four 722-entry u16 weight arrays 1460 bytes apart: the DECK pool
 * first, then the three drop pools the Drop Table Manager already shows, then
 * a 200-byte rank table and 104 bytes nothing reads. Each array sums to 2048.
 *
 * The stock pools are baked from the player's disc at build time
 * (tools/gen_drop_db.py), so this module can show all thirty-nine without a
 * duel; an EDIT is installed as a sector override on that record, which means
 * the game loads the edited pool through its own loader and nothing has to be
 * written into RAM at the right moment.
 *
 * The LBA is checked, not trusted: install_deck() reads the stock sectors
 * back and refuses unless the three DROP pools inside them match the baked
 * database byte for byte. Two independent derivations of the same bytes --
 * the build-time stream offset and this LBA -- agreeing is what makes the
 * write safe.
 *
 * AI. gDuel_aOpponentData (0x800917F0) is 40 nine-byte profiles indexed by
 * opponent id, in the EXE's data, resident from boot and never reloaded.
 * Ai_GetHandSize returns b[0]; the AI SCRIPTS reach the rest through
 * AiScript_LoadOpponentData, which reads b[field + 1] -- and multiplies b[1]
 * by 100 for field 0. The stock table rises with the campaign (Simon
 * 5,20,10,1,1,0,0,25,50 against Nitemare 20,10,5,2,2,5,5,75,0), so the bytes
 * are the opponent's difficulty knobs.
 *
 * WHAT EACH BYTE DOES, and how that was found. The AI is a bytecode VM: the
 * 67-entry handler table at gAiScript_apfnCommand (0x800916E0) names every
 * opcode, and the duel's script is the 0x1800 bytes at 0x801A8000. Reading
 * the operand shape of each handler out of the decompilation (and, for the
 * seven it has not reached yet, out of this build's own recompiled C, by
 * counting their calls to AiScript_ReadByte) is enough to disassemble it.
 * The field number is INDIRECT -- LoadOpponentData takes mem[] slots, not
 * literals -- so each read was traced back to the Store that set the slot:
 *
 *   b[1]   the script's field 0, x100, compared against a life point total
 *          (10/20/30 = 1000/2000/3000 LP) ahead of a weakest-monster search
 *   b[2]   compared against the AI's remaining deck size immediately before
 *          the fusion / combo search
 *   b[3]   read into the slot the best-combo search is handed
 *   b[4]   minus one, handed to EvaluateFusion: how deep it looks
 *   b[8]   the first thing the duel script reads, before anything happens
 *
 * b[5] and b[6] are equal in every stock profile and rise 0 -> 5 across the
 * campaign, but nothing in the resident script reads them, so they are left
 * named for what they look like rather than dressed up.
 *
 * The script also opens with a chain that singles out opponent ids 15, 35,
 * 36, 37 and 38 -- Pegasus, Heishin 2nd, Seto 3rd, DarkNite, Nitemare -- and
 * sets one flag for them and another for everyone else. That is the game's
 * own list of special opponents, and the community's "Pegasus reads your
 * face-downs" is exactly those five. Nothing in the script reads the flag
 * back, so what it turns on lives in native code and is not exposed here.
 *
 * RECORD. gFreeDuel_aDuelistRecords (0x801D071C) in the save: 40 x {u16 win,
 * u16 loss}, duelist ids from +4. The campaign does not touch it (only
 * FreeDuel_Init does), so it is exactly the Free Duel screen's WIN n LOSS n.
 *
 * NAME. The Free Duel grid prints string 0x8328 + cell for the cell under
 * the cursor (FreeDuel_PlaceCursor; teatools/image-freeduel), and cell = id
 * (0 is the Build Deck tile). Those are entries 808..847 of the u16 offset
 * table at gText_aGlobalOffsets (0x801D5800), the table the card names
 * share, each an offset from 0x801D0000 to an 0xFF-ended string in the
 * game's frequency-ordered glyph code. Checked 2026-09-06 by decoding the
 * SLUS: the forty entries read Build Deck, Simon Muran ... Duel Master K,
 * the order tools/gen_drop_db.py already uses. A rename is done the way a
 * card rename is (psx_card_packs.c): the encoded string is written to
 * reclaimed RAM and the entry repointed at it, both re-asserted per frame,
 * because the table is EXE data a savestate puts back. The strings sit in
 * fixed slots at the top of the name blob's free tail, above the card
 * renames (psx_card_packs.h says where the tail ends and why).
