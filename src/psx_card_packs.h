/* psx_card_packs.h — replace a stock card in every screen at once.
 *
 * A "card pack" is a folder <player-data>/cards/<id>/ holding a card.ini and
 * optional PNGs. The mod turns it into (a) replacement disc sectors for the
 * card's 2D art record and its duel thumbnail, served through the runtime's
 * sector overrides, and (b) per-frame writes of the card's name, stats word
 * and level/attribute byte into the EXE tables. Library page, chest viewer,
 * password screen, build-deck list and the duel all read from those two
 * places, so one pack covers all of them. See psx_card_packs.c.
