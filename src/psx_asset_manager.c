/* psx_asset_manager.c -- see psx_asset_manager.h.
 *
 * A reference window beside the game, same family as the Card/Dialogue/
 * Fusion managers: browse what psx_wa_catalog.c's ONE TABLE knows how to
 * export, compare the stock picture against whatever the active HD texture
 * pack currently has for it, and upload a replacement without leaving the
 * game or hand-typing a folder path.
 *
 * CATEGORIES AND ASSETS, NOT ONE FLAT LIST
 * -----------------------------------------
 * The catalog table already groups related art into "families" (a name_fmt
 * like "cards/art/%03d"); this window turns that into the two-level browser
 * the texture-pack folder itself already is. A category is everything in a
 * name_fmt up to its LAST '/' ("cards/art", "ui/font", "backgrounds/comp");
 * an asset is one instance of it ("001", "font", "01_layer1"). Two different
 * table rows land in the same category when they share that prefix (the
 * three duel_fields rows, the three background layers), which is exactly
 * how the exporter already piles them into one folder.
 *
 * STOCK VS PACK, NOT STOCK VS "REPLACED"
 * -----------------------------------------
 * The stock side always decodes fresh from the disc via psx_wa_catalog_
 * decode() -- the same call the exporter makes, so what this window shows
 * is exactly what "Export stock textures" would write. The pack side reads
 * whatever PNG currently sits at the path the exporter and the injector both
 * use, at ITS OWN resolution (no forced resize): psx_ui_blit_scaled already
 * scales an arbitrary source into a fixed box, so a 4x painted replacement
 * shows the upscale it actually is instead of being squashed to stock size.
 *
 * MULTI-REGION UI ART HAS NO SINGLE "PACK FILE" TO SHOW
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * Most families export as one flat PNG per asset and this window treats them
 * that way: pick one, see two pictures, click Upload to replace the second.
 * But a UI sheet drawn through more than one palette (psx_wa_catalog_ui(a) &&
 * a->tint != 1 -- duel_labels, duel_panels, the monster-type icons, the menu labels,
 * panels, dialog_frame, card_sleeves/canvas) exports as MANY small files
 * named by a content hash, one per (rectangle, palette) pair the game was
 * actually seen drawing -- see psx_texture_export.c's write_elements/
 * write_screens. There is no single path to preview or replace for these;
 * pretending otherwise would either show the wrong thing or invite an
 * upload that the injector would never look for. This window instead lists
 * whatever region files already exist for it and says so plainly.
 *
 * Same skeleton as psx_dialogue_manager.c: created on open and destroyed on
 * close, the F10 menu's toolkit and palette, sizes in design units (one
 * 480th of the window height), the software renderer on Windows and the
 * accelerated one elsewhere with the game's GL context put back after every
 * renderer call (PSX_TOOL_RENDERER overrides).
